out is an easy to use php class to get variable information, it's as simple as:

out::e($var1,$var2 [,...]);

to get a detailed view of the variable. Check the code for the other functions provided.

NOTE: some of the stuff in out:i() currently requires php 5.3, I'll change that as soon as I need the function in a non-5.3 environment
